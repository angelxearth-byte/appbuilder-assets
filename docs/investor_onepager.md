# AppBuilder — Investor One‑Pager
Date: 2025-10-06

## Elevator pitch
AppBuilder is a subscription-based app builder platform (web + mobile) with an admin companion that enables 3‑click revenue operations for creators and small teams. Focus: code export, white-label, templates, and a product-led freemium funnel targeted at SMBs and agencies.

## Traction (modelled projections)
- 90 days (Base scenario): ~187 mean active users, revenue ~$22365.25
- 180 days (Base): mean active users ~259, revenue ~$64970.5
- 365 days (Base): mean active users ~335, revenue ~$183838.33

## Business model
- Starter: $25.0/mo, Pro: $60.0/mo, Business: $120.0/mo.
- Revenue is recurring subscription; margins improve as churn is reduced and freemium conversion optimized.

## Key metrics to monitor (weekly)
- Daily Starter & Pro organic acquisitions
- Activation rate (first publish within 7 days)
- 7-day & 30-day retention; churn by cohort
- MRR, ARPA, LTV/CAC

## Ask
- $150k to hire a growth engineer, produce 10 vertical templates, and fund 6 months of runway for SEO/content and community growth.
- Use of funds: 50% product/dev, 30% content/partnerships, 20% ops/infra.

## Why now
- No-code adoption continues; mid-market demand for exportable code + white-label options is growing. Many competitors lock advanced features behind high tiers — AppBuilder offers more value earlier, accelerating acquisition and retention.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: high churn — Mitigation: invest in onboarding and retention hooks first.
- Risk: slow organic growth — Mitigation: freemium viral loops, partnerships with agencies, content-led SEO.
